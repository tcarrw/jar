    "title": "Derivation: 1/7 Spiral Checkpoints",
    "body": "Goal: justify 7-day checkpoints inside a 42-day cycle.\n\nSetup:\n- Cycle length L=42 (6×7). Let weeks be w∈{1..6}.\n- Checkpoints at days D={7,14,21,28,35,42}.\n\nArgument:\n1) Nyquist cadence for weekly review: sampling period s=7 prevents drift by constraining error accumulation.\n2) Mid-cycle invariants: days divisible by 7 maximize continuity between lunar quarters and human weeks.\n3) Practical: batching scope changes to 6 slots yields predictable escalation windows.\n\nResult: escalate/consolidate only at D. Between checkpoints: stabilize or explore; avoid strategic pivots."

Avoid mid-day flips.\n- Record: end-of-day affect; AM dream tags.\n\nExpected:\n- Honey → ↑ consolidation, ↑ calm; Neon → ↑ initiation, ↑ novelty; Classic → neutral baseline.\n\nAnalysis: 2×3 mixed ANOVA day×mode; report η² and CIs. Archive in Science with plots (future)."
